# IRIS-ANN
ANN on Iris Dataset


#### Dataset Description:<br><br>
Design a Neural Network on IRIS dataset using Feed Forward Neural Network consisting of an input layer L0 consisting of m nodes for m features, two hidden layers L1 and L2 consisting of n and p nodes respectively, and an output layer L3 consisting of k nodes for k classes. Use Softmax Activation Function as Activation Parameter and Categorical Cross-Entropy Loss as Loss Function Design a ANN Model.

#### Expected Result:<br><br>
1. A technical report containing implementation details
2. Final parameter values at the end of training
3. Train vs Test loss
4. Train and Test accuracy
5. F1-Score, Classification report & Confusion Matrix
6. Plot of the loss function vs. epochs

#### Architecture:<br><br>
1. **Input Layer:** Relu Activation
2. **1st Hidden Layer:** Relu Activation
3. **2nd Hidden Layer:** Relu Activation
4. **Output Layer:** Softmax
5. **loss:** Categorical Cross Entropy
6. **optimizer:** Adam
7. **metrics:** accuracy
8. **Number of Epochs:** 200

a. This ANN consists here are of four layer first and last layer is input and output layer and having two layer in middle which is h1,h2.<br>
b. The sequential model here will connect together a list of layers in order from first to last.<br>
c. Using argument units we define how many output we want.Here Lo(Input)consists of 4 nodes,the two hidden layer consists of node n=15 & p=8 and an output consists of k=3 nodes.<br>
d. Dense layers are connected by lines and planes so we need something non-linear which is called activation functions.<br> 
e. After definig a model adding a loss function and optimizer with the model.compile method.<br>


#### Output:<br><br>
ANN Model was build has<br>
**Train Accuracy:** 0.9850<br>
**Test Accuracy:** 0.97<br>
**Train Loss:** 0.0415<br>
**Test Loss:** 0.0860<br>
